/// An automaton-like datastructure to evaluate sets of constraints efficiently.
///
/// Organises lists of constraints into an automaton, leading to performance
/// gains when many patterns (i.e. lists of constraints) are evaluated together.
/// The reduction in the number of constraints that must be evaluated (compared
/// to evaluating each constraint of each pattern individually) is achieved by
///   1. Ordering constraints and merging identical constraints across multiple
///      patterns,
///   2. Partition sets of constraints into mutually exclusive sets to exclude
///      non-matching patterns efficiently, and optionally break down complex
///      constraints into smaller atomic units,
///   3. Delaying in some cases the evaluation of constraints: if pattern P1 and
///      P2 evaluate constraints C1 and C2 respectively but C2 > C1, then we can
///      delay C2's evaluation for the case that it will be evaluated by P1 later on.
///
